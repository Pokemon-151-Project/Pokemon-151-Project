POKEMON 151 PROJECT

Introduction:

-A scalable, maintainable application that maps over and displays data in digestible cards

-HTML/CSS is highly semantic, accessible and responsive for readers of all screen sizes and abilities

-Right now, this displays Pokemon. One could easily scale this up to more than the original 151 Pokemon, or tweak it to any other data

-Persistent Dark/Light Mode preference is stored in localStorage and remembered across sessions

-Options for alternate(shiny) sprites

-Code is highly modular, with components and utils files for different functions and sections
